## Circle Calculations Program

Write a program to obtain the radius of a circle as a parameter and use three different functions to find the diameter, circumference, and area of the circle. Each function should return the respective values.

### Function names:

```python
def find_Diameter(r)
def find_Circumference(r)
def find_Area(r)
```

#### Input format:
- The input consists of a floating-point number representing the radius of the circle.

#### Output format:
- The output prints the diameter, circumference, and area of the circle rounded off to two decimal places.

### Sample test cases:
#### Input 1:
```
2.15
```

#### Output 1:
```
Diameter of a circle = 4.30
Circumference of a circle = 13.50
Area of a circle = 14.51
```
