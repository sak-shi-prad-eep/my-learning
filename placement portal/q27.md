## Caption Contest - Estimating String Differences

Robin, a creative writer, found two captions for a contest but some letters in them have become unreadable. He wants to estimate the difference between these strings after replacing unreadable symbols ('?') with lowercase English letters.

### Problem Description:

Given two strings, S1 and S2, both of equal length:
- S1 and S2 may contain lowercase English letters and question marks ('?').
- The difference between the strings is defined as the number of positions where S1[i] is not equal to S2[i].

### Task:

Write a program to calculate the minimal and maximal difference between the two strings after replacing '?' with any lowercase English letter.

### Function Specifications:

- Function Name: Not specified (assume main program logic).
- Input: Two lines of input where:
  - The first line contains string S1.
  - The second line contains string S2.
- Output: Print the minimal and maximal difference between S1 and S2 separated by a single space.

### Input format:
- The first line of the input contains string S1.
- The second line of the input contains string S2.
- Both strings consist of lowercase English letters and '?'.

### Output format:
- Output a single line containing two integers separated by a space: the minimal and maximal difference between S1 and S2.

### Sample test cases:
#### Input 1:
```
a?c
??b
```
#### Output 1:
```
1 3
```
