## Print a Right-angled Triangle of Stars

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number `num`, and then prints a right-angled triangle of stars (`*`). The triangle should have `num` rows, with the first row having 1 star, the second row having 2 stars, and so on up to `num` stars in the last row.

# Logic

## Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Printing Right-angled Triangle of Stars:**
   - Use nested loops to iterate through each row and column to print the stars (`*`).
   - Outer loop (`for i in range(num+1)`) iterates from 0 to `num`, inclusive.
   - Inner loop (`for j in range(i)`) iterates `i` times to print `i` stars in the current row.
   - Prints stars (`*`) without a newline using `end=''`.
   - After printing all stars in a row, moves to the next line using `print()` without any arguments to print a newline.
