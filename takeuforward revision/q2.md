## Check if Number is Armstrong Number

Given an integer input `num1`, determine if it is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

#### Example:

Input: num1 = 153  
Output: Armstrong number

## Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `sum1 = 0`: Initializes a variable to store the sum of powers of individual digits.
   - `list1 = list(map(int, str(num1)))`: Converts the integer `num1` into a list of its digits.
   - `length = len(list1)`: Computes the number of digits in `num1`.

3. **Calculate Armstrong Number:**
   - Iterate through each digit `i` in `list1`.
   - Compute `i` raised to the power of `length` (`i = pow(i, length)`) and add it to `sum1`.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - Check if `sum1` equals `num1`.
   - Print "Armstrong number" if they are equal; otherwise, print "Nope".

#### Explanation of Armstrong Number:
An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:
- 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
