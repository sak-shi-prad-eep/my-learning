# Question
## Print a Diamond Pattern

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number `num`, and then prints a diamond pattern of stars (`*`). The diamond should have `num` rows, with the middle row having `2*num - 1` stars.

# Logic
---

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Printing Diamond Pattern:**
   - **Top Half:**
     - Use a loop (`for i in range(num + 1)`) to iterate from 0 to `num`, inclusive.
     - Inner loop 1 (`for j in range(num - i)`) prints leading spaces for each row to center-align the pattern.
     - Inner loop 2 (`for k in range(1, 2*i)`) prints stars (`*`) for each row. The range starts from 1 and ends at `2*i - 1` to generate an odd number of stars, which creates the top half of the diamond.
     - After printing all spaces and stars in a row, moves to the next line using `print()` without any arguments to print a newline.

   - **Bottom Half:**
     - Use a loop (`for i in range(num, 0, -1)`) to iterate from `num` down to 1.
     - Inner loop 1 (`for j in range(num - i)`) prints leading spaces for each row to center-align the pattern.
     - Inner loop 2 (`for k in range(1, 2*i)`) prints stars (`*`) for each row. The range starts from 1 and ends at `2*i - 1` to generate an odd number of stars, which creates the bottom half of the diamond.
     - After printing all spaces and stars in a row, moves to the next line using `print()` without any arguments to print a newline.
