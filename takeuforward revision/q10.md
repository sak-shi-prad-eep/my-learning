## Print a Reversed Right-angled Triangle of Stars

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number `num`, and then prints a reversed right-angled triangle of stars (`*`). The triangle should have `num` rows, where the first row has `num` stars, the second row has `num-1` stars, and so on down to 1 star in the last row.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Printing Reversed Right-angled Triangle of Stars:**
   - Use nested loops to iterate through each row and column to print the stars (`*`).
   - Outer loop (`for i in range(num, 0, -1)`) iterates from `num` down to 1.
   - Inner loop (`for j in range(i)`) iterates `i` times to print `i` stars in the current row.
   - Prints a star (`*`) followed by a space (`' '`), without a newline, using `end=' '`.
   - After printing all stars in a row, moves to the next line using `print()` without any arguments to print a newline.
