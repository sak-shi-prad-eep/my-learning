# Question
## Euclidean Algorithm for Finding GCD

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter two numbers `num1` and `num2`, and then computes and prints their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.

# Logic

## Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads the first integer input from the user.
   - `num2 = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads the second integer input from the user.

2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - Uses a while loop to iteratively find the GCD:
     - Continues looping as long as both `num1` and `num2` are greater than 0.
     - Checks which number is larger (`num1` or `num2`).
     - Computes the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number (`num1 % num2` or `num2 % num1`).
     - Updates the larger number with this remainder.
   - The loop terminates when one of the numbers becomes zero.
   - Prints the non-zero number as the GCD.

### Optimization Explanation:
- The Euclidean algorithm efficiently computes the GCD using the properties of division and remainder.
- This approach is more efficient than the brute force method (commented out in the code) that iterates from 1 to the maximum of `num1` and `num2`.
