# Question
## Check if a Number is Prime or Composite

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number `num`, and then checks whether it is prime or composite. A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. A composite number has more than two distinct positive divisors.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Prime or Composite Check:**
   - **Optimized Approach:**
     - Import the `math` module to utilize `math.sqrt()` for efficiency.
     - Calculate the square root of `num` (`sq = int(math.sqrt(num))`) to limit the range of divisors to check.
     - Initialize `count = 0` to count the number of divisors.
     - Use a loop (`for i in range(1, sq + 1)`) to iterate through potential divisors from 1 to `sq`.
     - Increment `count` each time `i` divides `num` evenly (`num % i == 0`).
     - If `i` is not equal to `num // i`, increment `count` again to account for both divisors (e.g., for `num = 16`, both 1 and 16, and 2 and 8 would be counted).
     - If `count > 2`, print `"composite"`; otherwise, print `"prime"`.
