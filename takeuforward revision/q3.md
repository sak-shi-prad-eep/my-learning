## Find Divisors of a Number

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number `num`, and then computes and prints all divisors of `num`. The program should optimize the divisor finding process by only iterating up to the square root of `num`.

# Logic

## Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Optimized Divisor Calculation:**
   - `sq = int(math.sqrt(num))`: Calculates the integer square root of `num`. This reduces the number of iterations needed because divisors come in pairs that multiply to `num`.

3. **Iterating through Potential Divisors:**
   - Iterates through numbers `i` from `1` to `sq + 1`.
   - Checks if `i` divides `num` evenly (`num % i == 0`).
   - If true, `i` is added to the list of divisors (`divisors.append(i)`).
   - Checks if `i` is not equal to `num // i` (to avoid adding the square root twice) and adds `num // i` to the list of divisors if true.

4. **Sorting and Output:**
   - `divisors.sort()`: Sorts the list of divisors in ascending order.
   - `print(divisors)`: Prints the sorted list of divisors.

### Optimization Explanation:
- By iterating up to the square root of `num`, the code efficiently finds pairs of divisors (`i` and `num // i`) without unnecessary computations.
- This approach reduces the time complexity compared to iterating up to `num`, making it more efficient for large numbers.
