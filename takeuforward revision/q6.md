## Print a Square of Stars

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number `num`, and then prints a square of stars (`*`) of size `num x num`.

# Logic

## Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Printing Square of Stars:**
   - Use nested loops to print `num` rows and `num` columns of stars (`*`).
   - Outer loop (`for i in range(num)`) iterates through each row.
   - Inner loop (`for j in range(num)`) iterates through each column within the current row.
   - Prints a star (`*`) without a newline using `end=''`.
   - After printing all stars in a row, moves to the next line using `print()` without any arguments to print a newline.
