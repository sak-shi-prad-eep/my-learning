## Print a Number Triangle in Reverse

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number `num`, and then prints a number triangle in reverse order where each row `i` contains numbers from 1 to `i`.

# Logic

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Printing Number Triangle in Reverse:**
   - Use nested loops to iterate through each row and column to print the numbers.
   - Outer loop (`for i in range(num, 0, -1)`) iterates from `num` down to 1.
   - Inner loop (`for j in range(i)`) iterates `i` times to print numbers from 1 to `i`.
   - Prints numbers (`j + 1`) followed by a space (`' '`), without a newline, using `end=' '`.
   - After printing all numbers in a row, moves to the next line using `print()` without any arguments to print a newline.
