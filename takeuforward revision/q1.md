# Count digits in a number

Given an integer N, return the number of digits in N.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
- Input: N = 12345
- Output: 5
- Explanation: The number 12345 has 5 digits.

**Example 2:**
- Input: N = 7789
- Output: 4
- Explanation: The number 7789 has 4 digits.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The user inputs a number which is converted to an integer `num1`.

2. **Convert to List of Digits:**
   - `list1 = list(map(int, str(num1)))`: This line converts the integer `num1` to a string, then maps each character (digit) of the string back to an integer. This creates a list `list1` containing the individual digits of `num1`.

3. **Calculate Length of Number:**
   - `length = len(list1)`: This calculates the length of `list1`, which corresponds to the number of digits in `num1`.

4. **Armstrong Number Check:**
   - The loop iterates through each digit `i` in `list1`.
   - `i = pow(i, length)`: Each digit `i` is raised to the power of `length`.
   - `sum1 += i`: The result of `i` raised to `length` is added to `sum1`.

5. **Comparison:**
   - `if sum1 == num1`: Checks if `sum1`, which is the sum of digits raised to the power of the number of digits, equals the original number `num1`.
   - If true, prints `"armstrong number"`, otherwise prints `"nope"`.

### Explanation:

The code essentially takes a number, converts it to a list of its digits, calculates the number of digits, and then checks if the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits equals the original number. If it does, it identifies the number as an Armstrong number; otherwise, it does not.

This approach uses basic Python functionalities such as converting types, mapping functions, and basic arithmetic operations to achieve its goal.
