# Question
## Print an Inverted Pyramid Pattern

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number `num`, and then prints an inverted pyramid pattern of stars (`*`). The pyramid should have `num` rows, with the top row having the maximum number of stars (`2*num - 1` stars) and decreasing by two stars with each subsequent row.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `num = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Printing Inverted Pyramid Pattern:**
   - Use nested loops to iterate through each row and column to print spaces and stars.
   - Outer loop (`for i in range(num, 0, -1)`) iterates from `num` down to 1.
   - Inner loop 1 (`for j in range(num - i)`) prints leading spaces for each row to center-align the pattern.
   - Inner loop 2 (`for k in range(1, 2*i)`) prints stars (`*`) for each row. The range starts from 1 and ends at `2*i - 1` to generate an odd number of stars, which creates a symmetrical inverted pyramid pattern.
   - After printing all spaces and stars in a row, moves to the next line using `print()` without any arguments to print a newline.
