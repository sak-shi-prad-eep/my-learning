# Question
## Print a Number Triangle

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number `num`, and then prints a number triangle where each row `i` contains numbers from 1 to `i`.

# Logic

1. **Input Reading:**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number `num`.
   - `num = int(input("Enter a number: "))`: Reads an integer input from the user.

2. **Printing Number Triangle:**
   - Use nested loops to iterate through each row and column to print the numbers.
   - Outer loop (`for i in range(1, num + 1)`) iterates from 1 to `num`, inclusive.
   - Inner loop (`for j in range(1, i + 1)`) iterates from 1 to `i`, inclusive, to print numbers from 1 to `i`.
   - Prints numbers (`j`) without a newline using `end=''`.
   - After printing all numbers in a row, moves to the next line using `print()` without any arguments to print a newline.
