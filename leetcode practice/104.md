Sure, let's break down the logic for all three implementations of the `maxDepth` function, each using a different approach (DFS with stack, BFS with queue, and recursive DFS).

### DFS with Stack
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        stack = [[root, 1]]
        res = 0
        while stack:
            node, depth = stack.pop()
            if node:
                stack.append([node.left, depth + 1])
                stack.append([node.right, depth + 1])
                res = max(res, depth)
        return res
```

**Logic Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an empty stack `stack` and initialize `res` to 0 to store the maximum depth found.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - Push the root node `root` and its depth `1` onto the stack `stack`.
   - While the stack is not empty, pop the top element which consists of a node `node` and its depth `depth`.
   - If `node` exists (not None), push its left child `node.left` and right child `node.right` onto the stack with incremented depth (`depth + 1`).
   - Update `res` with the maximum depth encountered during traversal.

3. **Return:**
   - After the stack is empty, `res` contains the maximum depth of the binary tree.

### BFS with Queue 
**Logic Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - Use a deque `q` to facilitate BFS traversal.
   - Start with `root` if it exists, and initialize `level` to 0 to count the depth levels.

2. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Iterate while `q` is not empty.
   - For each level, process all nodes currently in `q` by iterating over the current size of `q`.
   - For each node, add its left and right children to `q` if they exist.
   - Increment `level` after processing each level of nodes.

3. **Return:**
   - After the loop, `level` contains the maximum depth of the binary tree.

### Recursive DFS 

**Logic Explanation:**
1. **Base Case:**
   - If `root` is None, return 0 because there are no nodes in the subtree.

2. **Recursive Depth Calculation:**
   - Calculate the maximum depth of the left subtree using `self.maxDepth(root.left)`.
   - Calculate the maximum depth of the right subtree using `self.maxDepth(root.right)`.
   - Return `1 + max(left_depth, right_depth)` which represents the current node's depth plus the maximum depth of its subtrees.

3. **Recursive Approach:**
   - This approach recursively computes the maximum depth by exploring each subtree until it reaches leaf nodes (nodes with no children).
   - It returns the maximum depth from the root node down to the deepest leaf node.

### Summary:
- **DFS with Stack:** Uses an iterative approach with a stack to explore each node's children depth-first, updating the maximum depth along the way.
- **BFS with Queue:** Implements breadth-first search using a queue to explore nodes level by level, counting the number of levels traversed until all nodes are processed.
- **Recursive DFS:** Utilizes recursion to compute the maximum depth by exploring each subtree recursively and returning the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees plus one for the current node.

Each approach achieves the same result—finding the maximum depth of a binary tree—but differs in implementation style and traversal strategy (iterative vs. recursive, DFS vs. BFS).
