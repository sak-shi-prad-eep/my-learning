# Question
## 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

#### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

## `productExceptSelf` Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Result Array:**
   - Create an array `result` of the same length as `nums` initialized with `1`. This array will store the final product values.

2. **Calculate Prefix Products:**
   - Traverse through `nums` from left to right. For each element at index `i`, store the product of all elements to its left in `result[i]`. Use a variable `prefix` to keep track of this cumulative product.

3. **Calculate Postfix Products:**
   - Traverse through `nums` from right to left. For each element at index `i`, multiply the current `result[i]` by the product of all elements to its right (`postfix`). Update `postfix` as you traverse to accumulate the product of elements to the right.

4. **Return Result:**
   - The `result` array now contains the product of all elements except `nums[i]` at each index `i`, fulfilling the requirement.

#### Summary:

- This approach utilizes two passes through the `nums` array (`O(n)` time complexity), avoiding division operations.
- By using prefix and postfix products, each element in `result` efficiently computes the product of all elements except itself.
- This method ensures the solution meets the constraints and efficiently computes the desired output array.
