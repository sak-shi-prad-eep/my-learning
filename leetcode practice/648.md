# Question
## 648. Replace Words

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

#### Example:
```
Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

## Trie Data Structure and `replaceWords` Function Explanation:

1. **Trie Implementation:**
   - Define a `TrieNode` class to represent each node in the Trie structure. Each node has children (other nodes) and an `isEnd` flag indicating if it marks the end of a valid root word.
   - Implement a `Trie` class that supports methods for inserting words (`insert`) and searching for the shortest prefix (`search`) that forms a root word.

2. **Insertion into Trie:**
   - Populate the Trie with all roots from the `dictionary`. For each root, insert it into the Trie ensuring that each character leads to the next node in the Trie.

3. **Searching and Replacement:**
   - Iterate through each word in the `sentence`.
   - Use the Trie's `search` method to find the shortest root that matches the beginning of the current word. If no matching root is found, keep the original word.
   - Append the result of each search (either the shortest root or the original word) to the `result` list.

4. **Constructing the Output:**
   - Join the elements of the `result` list into a single string separated by spaces, forming the modified sentence with replaced roots.

#### Summary:

- The `replaceWords` function utilizes a Trie data structure to efficiently replace derivatives in a sentence with their shortest root form.
- By inserting all roots into the Trie and searching for prefixes in each word of the sentence, the function ensures that each derivative is replaced with the shortest root possible.
- This approach optimizes both the search and replacement operations, providing a clear and efficient solution to the problem of replacing derivatives with their root forms in English words.
