# Question
## 100. Same Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

#### Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

#### Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

## isSameTree Function Explanation:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - `if not p and not q: return True`: If both `p` and `q` are `None`, they are identical trees, so return `True`.
   - `if not p or not q: return False`: If either `p` or `q` is `None` but not both, they cannot be identical, so return `False`.

2. **Recursive Comparison:**
   - `if p.val != q.val: return False`: If the values of the current nodes `p` and `q` are not equal, they are not identical, so return `False`.
   - Recursively compare the left subtrees (`p.left` and `q.left`) and right subtrees (`p.right` and `q.right`) of `p` and `q`. Return `True` only if both left and right subtrees are identical.

#### Summary:

- `isSameTree` checks if two binary trees `p` and `q` are structurally identical and have the same node values by recursively comparing nodes.
- The function leverages recursion to traverse and compare binary tree structures effectively, ensuring clarity and simplicity in checking tree equality.
