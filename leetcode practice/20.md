# Question
## 20. Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

### Example 1:

Input: `s = "()"`  
Output: `true`

### Example 2:

Input: `s = "()[]{}"`  
Output: `true`

### Example 3:

Input: `s = "(]"`  
Output: `false`

## isValid Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Stack and Bracket Map:**
   - Use a list `stack` to keep track of the open brackets.
   - Use a dictionary `brackets` to map each type of open bracket to its corresponding close bracket.

2. **Iterate Through Characters:**
   - Use a for loop to iterate through each character in the string `s`.

3. **Handle Open Brackets:**
   - If the character is an open bracket (i.e., it is in the `brackets` dictionary), push it onto the stack.

4. **Handle Close Brackets:**
   - If the character is a close bracket:
     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `False` because there is no corresponding open bracket.
     - Pop the top element from the stack.
     - Check if the popped element is the matching open bracket for the current close bracket using the `brackets` dictionary. If it is not, return `False`.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After iterating through all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `True` because all open brackets have been closed correctly. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Summary:
- The `isValid` function uses a stack to ensure that open brackets are closed in the correct order and that every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket.
- The dictionary `brackets` helps in checking the matching pairs of brackets.
- The method efficiently validates the string by processing each character once, ensuring that the stack operations maintain the correct bracket structure.
