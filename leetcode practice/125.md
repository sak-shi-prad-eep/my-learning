# Question
## 125. Valid Palindrome

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

#### Example:
```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

## `isPalindrome` Function Explanation:

1. **Convert to Lowercase and Remove Non-Alphanumeric Characters:**
   - Use a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the string `s`.
   - Convert each character to lowercase using `char.lower()`.
   - Include only alphanumeric characters using `char.isalnum()`.

2. **Join Filtered Characters into a Single String:**
   - Use `''.join()` to concatenate the list of filtered characters into a single string called `filter`.

3. **Check if Filtered String is a Palindrome:**
   - Compare `filter` with its reverse (`filter[::-1]`). If they are the same, the string is a palindrome.

4. **Return Result:**
   - Return `True` if `filter` is a palindrome, otherwise return `False`.

#### Summary:

- The function effectively cleans the input string by converting it to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters.
- It then checks if the cleaned string reads the same forwards and backwards, ensuring that the function can identify palindromic phrases accurately.
