# Question
## 143. Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

### Example:

Input: `head = [1,2,3,4]`  
Output: `[1,4,2,3]`

Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
Output: `[1,5,2,4,3]`

# Logic

## reorderList Function Explanation:

1. **Check Base Cases:**
   - If `head` is `None` or `head.next` is `None`, return immediately as the list is empty or has only one node.

2. **Find the Middle of the Linked List:**
   - Use the slow and fast pointers technique to find the middle of the linked list.
   - Split the list into two halves: `first_half` and `second_half`.

3. **Reverse the Second Half:**
   - Reverse the `second_half` of the linked list using an iterative approach.

4. **Merge the Two Halves:**
   - Merge `first_half` and the reversed `second_half` by adjusting pointers.
   - Alternate between nodes from `first_half` and `second_half` to achieve the reordered list structure.

### Summary:
- The `reorderList` function reorders a singly linked list such that the nodes are rearranged in a specific order (`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …`).
- It uses basic linked list operations like finding the middle, reversing a linked list, and merging two linked lists.
- The algorithm runs efficiently with `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list, making it suitable for practical use cases in handling linked list manipulations.
