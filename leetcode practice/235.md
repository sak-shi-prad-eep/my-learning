# Question
## 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

### Example 1:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8  
Output: 6  
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

# Logic

## lowestCommonAncestor Function Explanation:

1. **Start from Root:**
   - Initialize a variable `cur` to the root node.

2. **Traverse the Tree:**
   - Use a while loop to traverse the tree.

3. **Check Node Values:**
   - If both `p` and `q` values are greater than the current node (`cur.val`), move to the right subtree.
   - If both `p` and `q` values are less than the current node, move to the left subtree.

4. **Found LCA:**
   - If one value is greater and one is less (or equal), the current node is the lowest common ancestor, so return `cur`.

#### Summary:

- The function finds the lowest common ancestor by leveraging the properties of a BST, where the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater.
- By comparing the values of `p` and `q` to the current node, the function efficiently narrows down the search space to find the LCA.
- The traversal continues until the condition for finding the LCA is met, ensuring the solution is both simple and effective.
