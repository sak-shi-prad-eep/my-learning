# Question
## 141. Linked List Cycle

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

### Example 1:
Input: `head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1`  
Output: `true`  
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

### Example 2:
Input: `head = [1,2], pos = 0`  
Output: `true`  
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

# Logic

## hasCycle Function Explanation:

1. **Check Base Cases:**
   - If `head` is `None` or `head.next` is `None`, return `False`. This handles cases where the list has 0 or 1 nodes, which cannot form a cycle.

2. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. `slow` moves one step at a time (`slow = slow.next`), while `fast` moves two steps at a time (`fast = fast.next.next`).

3. **Detect Cycle:**
   - Traverse the linked list using the `slow` and `fast` pointers. If there is a cycle, eventually `slow` and `fast` will meet (`slow == fast`).

4. **Return Result:**
   - If a cycle is detected during traversal, return `True`.
   - If `fast` or `fast.next` becomes `None`, indicating the end of the list without a cycle, return `False`.

### Summary:
- The `hasCycle` function determines whether a linked list contains a cycle by using two pointers (slow and fast) to detect if they meet at any point during traversal.
- This approach ensures an efficient `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list, making it suitable for checking cycle presence in large linked lists.
- It provides a straightforward and effective way to handle cycle detection in singly linked lists using basic pointer manipulation techniques.
