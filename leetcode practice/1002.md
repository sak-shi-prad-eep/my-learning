# Question
## 1002. Find Common Characters

Given a string array `words`, return an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the `words` (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
```

## `commonChars` Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Result List:**
   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store common characters.

2. **Iterate Over Characters:**
   - Iterate through each character from 'a' to 'z' using ASCII values (`ord('a')` to `ord('z')`).

3. **Find Minimum Count:**
   - For each character, initialize `min_count` to infinity (`float('inf')`).
   - Iterate through each word in the `words` array and count occurrences of the current character using `word.count(char)`.
   - Update `min_count` to be the minimum of its current value and the count of the current character in the current word.
   - If `min_count` becomes zero during any iteration, break out of the loop since further counting for this character is unnecessary.

4. **Add to Result:**
   - Extend the `result` list with `min_count` occurrences of the current character (`min_count * [char]`).

5. **Return Result:**
   - After iterating through all characters, return the `result` list containing all common characters.

#### Summary:

- The `commonChars` function uses nested loops to iterate through each character from 'a' to 'z' and each word in the `words` array.
- It counts occurrences of each character in each word and determines the minimum count across all words for each character.
- Characters with non-zero minimum counts across all words are added to the `result` list, which is then returned as the final output.
