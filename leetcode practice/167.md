# Question
## 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

## `twoSum` Function Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an empty dictionary `hashset` to store the numbers we have seen so far along with their indices.

2. **Iterate Through Numbers:**
   - Loop through the `numbers` list using `enumerate` to get both the index (`i`) and the value (`n`) of each element.

3. **Calculate Difference:**
   - For each number `n`, calculate the difference `diff` between the `target` and `n`.

4. **Check for Complement:**
   - If `diff` is found in `hashset`, it means we have previously seen a number that, when added to `n`, equals the `target`.
   - Return the indices of the two numbers. Since the problem is 1-indexed, add 1 to both indices and return them as a list.

5. **Store the Number:**
   - If `diff` is not found in `hashset`, store the number `n` in the dictionary with its index `i`.

#### Summary:

- This function uses a hash table to keep track of the numbers we have encountered so far and their indices.
- By checking if the complement of the current number exists in the hash table, we can efficiently find the pair of numbers that sum up to the target.
- The function ensures that the solution uses constant extra space and returns the correct 1-indexed positions of the numbers that sum to the target.
