# Question
## 633. Sum of Square Numbers

Given a non-negative integer `c`, decide whether there're two integers `a` and `b` such that `a^2 + b^2 = c`.

### Example 1:

Input: `c = 5`  
Output: `true`  
Explanation: `1^2 + 2^2 = 5`

### Example 2:

Input: `c = 3`  
Output: `false`

## judgeSquareSum Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Initialize `a` to `0` and `b` to the integer square root of `c` (`int(sqrt(c))`).

2. **Two-pointer Technique:**
   - Use a while loop to iterate while `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
   - Calculate `eqn` as `a^2 + b^2`.

3. **Check Conditions:**
   - If `eqn` equals `c`, return `True` because we found integers `a` and `b` such that `a^2 + b^2 = c`.
   - If `eqn` is greater than `c`, decrement `b` (move left in the range of possible `b` values).
   - If `eqn` is less than `c`, increment `a` (move right in the range of possible `a` values).

4. **Return False if Not Found:**
   - If the loop completes without finding such integers `a` and `b`, return `False`.

### Summary:
- The `judgeSquareSum` function uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently determine whether there exist two integers `a` and `b` such that `a^2 + b^2 = c`.
- It leverages the properties of squares and the non-decreasing nature of squares as `a` and `b` increase or decrease, ensuring `O(sqrt(c))` time complexity.
- This approach ensures that the solution is optimal for checking the sum of squares up to a given integer `c`.
