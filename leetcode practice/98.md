# Question
## 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]  
Output: true

# Logic

## isValidBST Function Explanation:

1. **Helper Function Definition:**
   - Define a helper function `valid(node, left, right)` that checks if the tree rooted at `node` is a valid BST within the range `(left, right)`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - If `node` is `None` (i.e., an empty tree), return `True` since an empty tree is a valid BST.

3. **Check Current Node Value:**
   - If the current node's value is not within the valid range `(left, right)`, return `False`.

4. **Recursive Check:**
   - Recursively check the left subtree with the range `(left, node.val)` and the right subtree with the range `(node.val, right)`.
   - Return `True` only if both subtrees are valid BSTs.

5. **Initial Call:**
   - Call the helper function with the root node and the initial range `(-infinity, +infinity)`.

#### Summary:

- The function validates the BST property by ensuring that each node's value falls within the allowed range, which is updated as the function traverses down the tree.
- The recursive approach checks both the left and right subtrees to ensure they also satisfy the BST properties.
- This method ensures that the entire tree adheres to the BST rules, leveraging the properties of recursion and range checks.
