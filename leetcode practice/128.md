# Question
## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

#### Example:
```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore, its length is 4.
```

## `longestConsecutive` Function Explanation:

1. **Using a Set for Fast Lookup:**
   - Convert `nums` into a set `set_nums` for O(1) average time complexity lookups.

2. **Iterate Through Each Number in `nums`:**
   - For each number `n` in `nums`, check if `n-1` exists in `set_nums`. If `n-1` does not exist, then `n` can be the starting point of a consecutive sequence.

3. **Calculate Length of Consecutive Sequence:**
   - Initialize `length` to 0 and increment it while `n + length` exists in `set_nums`. This counts the length of the consecutive sequence starting from `n`.

4. **Update `longest` if Necessary:**
   - Update `longest` with the maximum value of `longest` and `length`.

5. **Return `longest`:**
   - After iterating through all numbers in `nums`, `longest` will contain the length of the longest consecutive sequence found.

#### Summary:

- By using a set for fast membership checking, the algorithm efficiently identifies starting points of consecutive sequences.
- It iterates through each number once, checking and counting the consecutive sequence lengths in an optimal manner, ensuring O(n) time complexity.
