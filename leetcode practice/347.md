# Question
## 347. Top K Frequent Elements

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

#### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

## `topKFrequent` Function Explanation:

1. **Count Frequency:**
   - Initialize a `defaultdict` named `dict1` to count the frequency of each number in the input array `nums`.

2. **Sort by Frequency:**
   - Convert `dict1` to a list of tuples using `items()` method and sort these tuples based on the frequency (`item[1]`) in descending order (`reverse=True`).

3. **Extract Top K Elements:**
   - Extract the first `k` elements from the sorted list (`dict1[:k]`) and collect only the numbers (`item[0]`).

4. **Return Result:**
   - Return the list `top` containing the top `k` most frequent elements.

#### Summary:

- The `topKFrequent` function efficiently computes the `k` most frequent elements in the array `nums` using a `defaultdict` for frequency counting and sorting the dictionary items.
- Sorting the dictionary items based on frequency allows the function to quickly identify and extract the top `k` elements.
- This approach leverages dictionary operations and sorting, resulting in a time complexity that is primarily driven by the sorting step, which is `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. This ensures efficient computation of the most frequent elements.
