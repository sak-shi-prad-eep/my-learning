# Question
## 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted integer array nums, remove duplicate elements in-place such that each unique element appears only once. Maintain the original order of elements. Return the number of unique elements (k).

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]  
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]  
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]  
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]  
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

## removeDuplicates Function Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `l = 1`: Initialize a pointer `l` to 1, representing the next position to place a unique element in the modified array.

2. **Iterate through Array:**
   - Loop through the array `nums` starting from index 1 (`r` from 1 to len(nums)-1).
   
3. **Check for Duplicates:**
   - If `nums[r]` is not equal to `nums[r-1]` (previous element), it indicates a new unique element.
   
4. **Place Unique Elements:**
   - Move the unique element `nums[r]` to the position `l` in the array and increment `l` by 1.
   
5. **Return Unique Count:**
   - Return `l`, which now represents the count of unique elements in `nums` up to index `l-1`.

#### Summary:

- The `removeDuplicates` function modifies the input array `nums` in-place to remove duplicates while maintaining the order of unique elements.
- It uses a two-pointer approach (`l` and `r`) where `l` tracks the position for placing unique elements and `r` iterates through the array to find new unique elements.
- This approach ensures that duplicates are removed efficiently in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array.
