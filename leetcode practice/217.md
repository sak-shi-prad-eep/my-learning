# Question
## 217. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and `false` if every element is distinct.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

# Logic

## `containsDuplicate` Function Explanation:

1. **HashSet Usage:**
   - Initialize an empty `hashset` to keep track of unique elements encountered so far.

2. **Iterate Through Array:**
   - Iterate through each element `i` in the array `nums`.
   
3. **Check Duplicate:**
   - For each element `i`, check if it already exists in the `hashset`.
   - If `i` is found in `hashset`, return `True` indicating that a duplicate exists.
   - If not found, add `i` to the `hashset` to keep track of it.

4. **No Duplicates Found:**
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return `False`.

#### Summary:

- The `containsDuplicate` function uses a `hashset` to efficiently determine if there are any duplicates in the `nums` array.
- It iterates through each element of the array and checks if the element has already been seen by querying the `hashset`.
- If a duplicate is found during iteration, it returns `True`; otherwise, after completing the iteration, it returns `False`, indicating no duplicates were found.
