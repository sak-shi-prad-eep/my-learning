# Question
## 49. Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

#### Example:
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

## `groupAnagrams` Function Explanation:

1. **Using defaultdict for Grouping:**
   - Initialize a `defaultdict` named `anagram` where the default value is an empty list. This dictionary will store sorted versions of words as keys and lists of anagrams as values.

2. **Iterate Through Each Word:**
   - For each word in the input list `strs`, sort its characters to create a key (`sort`). This key represents the unique signature of anagrams since all anagrams will produce the same sorted string.

3. **Grouping Anagrams:**
   - Append each word to the list stored at `anagram[sort]`. This effectively groups all words that are anagrams of each other under the same key.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Convert `anagram.values()` to a list to get all the grouped lists of anagrams.

#### Summary:

- The `groupAnagrams` function efficiently groups anagrams together using a dictionary (`defaultdict`) where keys are sorted versions of words and values are lists of anagrams.
- By sorting each word and using the sorted version as a key in the dictionary, the function ensures that all anagrams map to the same key, facilitating easy grouping and retrieval of anagram groups.
- This approach leverages sorting and dictionary operations to achieve linear time complexity relative to the total number and length of words, providing an optimal solution for grouping anagrams in the input list `strs`.
