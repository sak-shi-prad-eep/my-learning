# Question
## 27. Remove Element

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
Return `k`.

#### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3`  
Output: `2`, `nums = [2,2,_,_]`  
Explanation: Your function should return `k = 2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being `2`.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

#### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2`  
Output: `5`, `nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]`  
Explanation: Your function should return `k = 5`, with the first five elements of `nums` containing `0, 1, 4, 0, 3`.  
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

# Logic

## removeElement Function Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `l = 0`: Initialize a pointer `l` to track the position to place elements that are not equal to `val`.

2. **Iterate and Compare:**
   - Iterate through the array `nums`.
   - If `nums[r] != val`, it means the current element should be kept:
     - Set `nums[l] = nums[r]`.
     - Increment `l` by `1`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - After iterating through the array, `l` will represent the number of elements in `nums` that are not equal to `val`.
   - Return `l`.

---

#### Summary:

- The `removeElement` function modifies the input array `nums` in-place to remove all occurrences of `val`.
- It uses two pointers (`l` and `r`) to track positions in the array and compares elements to identify and retain elements that are not equal to `val`.
- The function returns the count of elements (`k`) that are not equal to `val` and ensures the first `k` elements of `nums` contain these elements in any order.
