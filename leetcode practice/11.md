# Question
## 11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`-th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container such that the container holds the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### Example 1:

Input: `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`  
Output: `49`  
Explanation: The vertical lines are represented by the array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. The maximum area of water (blue section) the container can hold is `49`.

### Example 2:

Input: `height = [1,1]`  
Output: `1`

## maxArea Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Result:**
   - Use two pointers: `l` (left) starting at the beginning of the array and `r` (right) starting at the end of the array.
   - Initialize a variable `res` to store the maximum area found.

2. **Calculate Area:**
   - Use a while loop to iterate as long as `l` is less than `r`.
   - Calculate the area using the formula `min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)`. This formula multiplies the smaller height between the two pointers by the distance between the pointers.

3. **Update Maximum Area:**
   - Update `res` with the maximum value between the current calculated area and the previous maximum area.

4. **Move Pointers:**
   - If the height at the left pointer (`height[l]`) is less than the height at the right pointer (`height[r]`), move the left pointer one step to the right (`l += 1`).
   - Otherwise, move the right pointer one step to the left (`r -= 1`).

5. **Return Result:**
   - After the loop ends, return the maximum area stored in `res`.

### Summary:
- The `maxArea` function uses a two-pointer technique to find the maximum water container.
- The pointers start at both ends of the array and move towards each other, calculating the area at each step and updating the maximum area found.
- The method ensures efficiency by narrowing down the potential maximum area through the movement of pointers based on the height comparison.
