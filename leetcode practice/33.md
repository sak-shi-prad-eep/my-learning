# Question
## 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0`  
Output: `4`

### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3`  
Output: `-1`

### Example 3:

Input: `nums = [1], target = 0`  
Output: `-1`

## search Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Initialize `l` (left) to 0 and `r` (right) to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - Use a while loop to perform binary search until `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Calculate the midpoint `m` as `(l + r) // 2`.

3. **Check Middle Element:**
   - If `nums[m]` equals `target`, return `m` because the target is found.

4. **Determine Sorted Half:**
   - Check if the left half (`nums[l]` to `nums[m]`) is sorted:
     - If `nums[l] <= nums[m]`, then the left half is sorted.
     - Check if the target is within the range `[nums[l], nums[m]]`:
       - If `target` is within this range, adjust `r` to `m - 1` to search in the left half.
       - Otherwise, adjust `l` to `m + 1` to search in the right half.
   
5. **Handle Unsorted Half:**
   - If the left half is not sorted, then the right half (`nums[m]` to `nums[r]`) must be sorted.
   - Check if the target is within the range `[nums[m], nums[r]]`:
     - If `target` is within this range, adjust `l` to `m + 1` to search in the right half.
     - Otherwise, adjust `r` to `m - 1` to search in the left half.

6. **Return -1 if Target Not Found:**
   - If the loop ends and `target` is not found, return `-1`.

### Summary:
- The `search` function utilizes a binary search approach to efficiently find the index of `target` in a rotated sorted array `nums`.
- It dynamically adjusts the search range based on whether the left or right half is sorted, ensuring `O(log n)` time complexity.
- This approach leverages the properties of binary search to quickly locate the target element or determine its absence in the array.
