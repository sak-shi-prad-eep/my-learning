# Question
## 226. Invert Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

### Example 1:
Input: `root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]`  
Output: `[4,7,2,9,6,3,1]`  
Explanation:  
```
    4                          4
   / \                        / \
  2   7          =>          7   2
 / \ / \                    / \ / \
1  3 6  9                  9  6 3  1
```

### Example 2:
Input: `root = [2,1,3]`  
Output: `[2,3,1]`  
Explanation:
```
    2                2
   / \    =>        / \
  1   3            3   1
```

### Example 3:
Input: `root = []`  
Output: `[]`

## invertTree Function Explanation:

1. **Base Case:**
   - Check if `root` is `None`. If so, return `None` because there's no tree to invert.

2. **Swapping Nodes:**
   - Swap the left and right subtrees of `root`. This can be achieved by using a temporary variable `tmp` to hold `root.left`, then assigning `root.left` to `root.right` and `root.right` to `tmp`.
   
3. **Recursive Inversion:**
   - Recursively call `invertTree` on the left and right subtrees of `root`. This effectively inverts all nodes in the tree starting from `root.left` and `root.right`.

4. **Return Result:**
   - Return `root` after inverting its left and right subtrees recursively.

### Summary:
- The `invertTree` function effectively inverts a binary tree by recursively swapping the left and right subtrees of each node.
- It handles the base case where `root` is `None`, ensuring it returns `None` for an empty tree (`[]`).
- Using simple recursive calls and temporary variable swapping, it efficiently inverts the entire binary tree structure.
- This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as each node is visited once.
