# Question
## 846. Hand of Straights

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the ith card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.

#### Example:
```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]
```

# Logic

## `isNStraightHand` Function Explanation:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - Check if the total number of cards (`len(hand)`) is divisible by `groupSize`. If not, return `False` because it's impossible to form equal groups.

2. **Counting Cards:**
   - Use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each card value in `hand`.

3. **Sorting Keys:**
   - Sort the keys of the `count` dictionary to process cards in ascending order.

4. **Group Formation:**
   - Iterate through each key (representing a card value) in the sorted keys.
   - For each card value, try to form a group of size `groupSize`.
   - Use a loop to check the availability of consecutive cards (`key`, `key+1`, ..., `key+groupSize-1`).
   - If any required card in the current group is not available (`count[key+i] == 0`), return `False`.
   - Otherwise, decrement the count of each card in the current group (`key`, `key+1`, ..., `key+groupSize-1`) and move to the next group.

5. **Success:**
   - If all groups can be formed successfully, return `True`.

#### Summary:

- The `isNStraightHand` function checks if Alice can rearrange her cards into groups of `groupSize` consecutive cards.
- It uses a `Counter` to count card occurrences and sorts card values to systematically form groups.
- By iterating through possible starting card values and checking consecutive availability, the function efficiently determines if the rearrangement is possible according to the given rules.
