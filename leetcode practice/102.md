# Question
## 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

# Logic

## levelOrder Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Queue and Result List:**
   - Create a deque (double-ended queue) `q` and a list `res` to store the result.
   - If the root is not null, add the root node to the queue.

2. **Level Order Traversal:**
   - Use a while loop to process nodes level by level as long as the queue is not empty.
   - For each level, create an empty list `level` to store the values of nodes at the current level.

3. **Process Current Level:**
   - Use a for loop to iterate over all nodes at the current level (number of nodes in the queue).
   - Dequeue a node from the queue and add its value to the `level` list.
   - If the node has a left child, add it to the queue.
   - If the node has a right child, add it to the queue.

4. **Store the Level:**
   - After processing all nodes at the current level, add the `level` list to the `res` list.

5. **Return Result:**
   - Return the `res` list, which contains the level order traversal of the tree.

#### Summary:

- The function uses a deque to facilitate level order traversal, ensuring efficient addition and removal of nodes.
- By processing nodes level by level, the function collects the values of nodes at each level in separate lists.
- The result is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the values of nodes at a particular level of the tree.
