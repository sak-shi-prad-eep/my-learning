# Question
## 15. 3Sum

Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]`  
Output: `[[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]`  
Explanation:  
`nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.`  
`nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.`  
`nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.`  
The distinct triplets are `[-1,0,1]` and `[-1,-1,2]`.

### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [0,1,1]`  
Output: `[]`  
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

### Example 3:

Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`  
Output: `[[0,0,0]]`  
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

## threeSum Function Explanation:

1. **Sorting:**
   - First, sort the array `nums`. This helps in efficiently finding triplets and avoiding duplicates.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Use a for loop to iterate through each number in the sorted array. Let `a` be the current number and `i` be its index.
   - If `a` is the same as the previous number (`nums[i-1]`), skip it to avoid duplicate triplets.

3. **Two-pointer Technique:**
   - For each `a`, use two pointers, `l` (left) starting from `i+1` and `r` (right) starting from the end of the array.
   - Calculate the sum of the triplet `a + nums[l] + nums[r]`.

4. **Sum Comparison:**
   - If the sum is greater than 0, move the right pointer `r` one step left to reduce the sum.
   - If the sum is less than 0, move the left pointer `l` one step right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is exactly 0, it means we found a valid triplet. Add `[a, nums[l], nums[r]]` to the result list `res`.

5. **Avoiding Duplicates:**
   - After finding a valid triplet, move the left pointer `l` to the right while skipping duplicate values to avoid adding the same triplet multiple times.

6. **Return Result:**
   - Finally, return the list `res` containing all unique triplets that sum to 0.
