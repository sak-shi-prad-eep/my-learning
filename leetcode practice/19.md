# Question
## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

### Example 1:
Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `n = 2`  
Output: `[1,2,3,5]`

### Example 2:
Input: `head = [1]`, `n = 1`  
Output: `[]`

### Example 3:
Input: `head = [1,2]`, `n = 1`  
Output: `[1]`

# Logic

## removeNthFromEnd Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Use a `dummy` node to handle cases where the first node (`head`) itself needs to be removed.
   - Set up `l` and `r` pointers where `l` starts from `dummy` and `r` starts from `head`.

2. **Move the `r` Pointer:**
   - Move `r` pointer `n` positions ahead to create a gap of `n+1` nodes between `l` and `r`.

3. **Move Both Pointers Together:**
   - Move both `l` and `r` pointers one step at a time until `r` reaches the end of the list (`r` becomes `None`).
   - Now, `l` points to the node just before the node to be removed (`l.next`).

4. **Remove the Nth Node:**
   - Adjust the `next` pointer of `l` to skip the node to be removed (`l.next = l.next.next`).

5. **Return the Updated List:**
   - Return `dummy.next` which points to the head of the updated list.

### Summary:
- The `removeNthFromEnd` function efficiently removes the nth node from the end of a singly linked list.
- It uses two pointers (`l` and `r`) to maintain a gap of `n` nodes and then adjusts pointers to remove the desired node.
- The algorithm operates in `O(L)` time complexity, where `L` is the length of the linked list, making it efficient and suitable for practical use in handling linked list deletions from the end.
