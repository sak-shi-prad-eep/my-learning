# Question
## 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

#### Example:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

## `twoSum` Function Explanation:

1. **Using Hash Map for Efficiency:**
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `hash_dict` to store the mapping of numbers to their indices as you iterate through `nums`.

2. **Iterate Through `nums`:**
   - For each number `n` at index `i` in `nums`, calculate the `diff` which is `target - n`.

3. **Check if `diff` Exists in `hash_dict`:**
   - If `diff` exists in `hash_dict`, it means there is another number in `nums` which when added to `n` gives `target`. Return the indices `[hash_dict[diff], i]`.

4. **Store Current Number in `hash_dict`:**
   - If `diff` does not exist in `hash_dict`, store the current number `n` along with its index `i` in `hash_dict`.

5. **Return Result:**
   - This approach ensures that each number is processed in constant time due to the hash map lookup, resulting in an efficient `O(n)` time complexity solution.

#### Summary:

- Using a hash map allows efficient checking of complement pairs (`target - n`).
- The algorithm iterates through `nums` once, storing each number and its index in `hash_dict`.
- By leveraging the hash map for quick lookups, the solution efficiently finds the indices of two numbers that sum up to `target`.
