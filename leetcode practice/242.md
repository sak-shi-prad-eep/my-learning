# Question
## 242. Valid Anagram

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

#### Example:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

## `isAnagram` Function Explanation:

1. **Convert Strings to Lists:**
   - Convert strings `s` and `t` into lists of characters using `list(s)` and `list(t)`.

2. **Sort Lists:**
   - Sort both lists `s` and `t` using the `sort()` method.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Compare the sorted lists `s` and `t` using the equality operator (`==`).
   - If they are equal, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

---

#### Summary:

- The `isAnagram` function checks if two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams by sorting their characters and comparing the sorted lists.
- Anagrams have identical sorted sequences of characters, ensuring that both strings contain exactly the same characters in exactly the same frequencies. This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies anagrams by their structural similarity after sorting.
