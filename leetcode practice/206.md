# Question
## 206. Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

### Example 1:

Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
Output: `[5,4,3,2,1]`

### Example 2:

Input: `head = [1,2]`  
Output: `[2,1]`

### Example 3:

Input: `head = []`  
Output: `[]`

# Logic

## reverseList Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Initialize `prev` to `None` (as there is no previous node initially).
   - Initialize `curr` to `head`, which is the starting node of the linked list.

2. **Reverse the List:**
   - Use a while loop to iterate through the linked list while `curr` is not `None`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Store the next node of `curr` in `nxt` (`curr.next`).
     - Reverse the pointer of `curr` to point to `prev` instead of its next node (`curr.next = prev`).
     - Move `prev` to `curr` (`prev = curr`) to advance the `prev` pointer.
     - Move `curr` to `nxt` (`curr = nxt`) to advance the `curr` pointer to the next node in the original list.

3. **Return the Reversed Head:**
   - Once the loop completes, `prev` will point to the new head of the reversed linked list.
   - Return `prev`, which is now the head of the reversed list.

### Summary:
- The `reverseList` function uses an iterative approach with three pointers (`prev`, `curr`, and `nxt`) to reverse a singly linked list in place.
- It efficiently rearranges the pointers to reverse the direction of each node, ensuring that the original list is reversed in `O(n)` time complexity.
- This method ensures that the entire linked list is processed once, making it both optimal and straightforward for reversing linked lists.
