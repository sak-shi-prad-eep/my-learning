## 572. Subtree of Another Tree


Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```

## `isSubtree` Function Explanation:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - `if not subRoot: return True`: If `subRoot` is `None`, then any subtree can match with `None`, so return `True`.
   - `if not root: return False`: If `root` is `None` but `subRoot` is not `None`, it's not possible for them to match, so return `False`.

2. **Recursive Matching:**
   - `if self.issametree(root, subRoot): return True`: Check if the current `root` and `subRoot` are the same trees using the `issametree` function. If they are, return `True`.
   
3. **Recursive Search:**
   - If the current `root` is not the same as `subRoot`, recursively check in the left and right subtrees of `root` (`root.left` and `root.right`). Return `True` if either subtree contains a subtree that matches `subRoot`.

## `issametree` Helper Function Explanation:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - `if not s and not t: return True`: If both `s` and `t` are `None`, they are identical, so return `True`.
   - `if not s or not t: return False`: If either `s` or `t` is `None` but not both, they cannot be identical, so return `False`.

2. **Recursive Comparison:**
   - `if s.val != t.val: return False`: If the values of current nodes `s` and `t` are not equal, they are not identical, so return `False`.
   - Recursively compare the left subtrees (`s.left` and `t.left`) and right subtrees (`s.right` and `t.right`) of `s` and `t`. Return `True` only if both left and right subtrees are identical.

---

#### Summary:

- `isSubtree` checks if `subRoot` is identical to any subtree of `root` by recursively comparing nodes using `issametree`.
- `issametree` compares if two trees (`s` and `t`) are identical recursively by checking node values and subtree structures.
- The functions leverage recursion to traverse and compare binary tree structures effectively, ensuring clarity and simplicity in checking subtree relationships.
