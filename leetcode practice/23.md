# Question
## 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

You are given an array of k linked-lists `lists`, where each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

### Example 1:
Input: `lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]`  
Output: `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]`  
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
```
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
```
Merging them into one sorted list:
`1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6`

### Example 2:
Input: `lists = []`  
Output: `[]`

### Example 3:
Input: `lists = [[]]`  
Output: `[]`

## mergeKLists Function Explanation:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - Check if `lists` is empty or contains no lists (`len(lists) == 0`). If so, return `None` because there are no lists to merge.

2. **Merge in Pairs:**
   - Use a while loop that continues as long as `len(lists) > 1`. This loop will merge pairs of lists into a new list and update `lists` with these merged lists.
   - Inside the loop, initialize an empty list `newlist` to store the merged lists.

3. **Merge Function (`merge`):**
   - This function merges two sorted linked lists (`l1` and `l2`):
     - Initialize a `dummy` node and a `tail` pointer.
     - Traverse through `l1` and `l2`, comparing the values of nodes and appending the smaller node to `tail.next`.
     - Move the respective pointer (`l1` or `l2`) to its next node and move `tail` to `tail.next`.
     - After exiting the loop, append any remaining nodes of `l1` or `l2` to `tail.next`.

4. **Update `lists`:**
   - Replace `lists` with `newlist` after merging all pairs. If there's an odd number of lists, the last list remains unmerged and is appended as is.

5. **Return Result:**
   - Return the head of the merged sorted linked list, which is `lists[0]` after all lists have been merged.

### Summary:
- The `mergeKLists` function merges `k` sorted linked lists into one sorted list by iteratively merging pairs of lists using the `merge` function.
- It efficiently handles edge cases such as empty lists (`lists = []`) or lists containing no nodes (`lists = [[]]`).
- By leveraging the `merge` function and iterative merging of lists, it achieves the task in `O(N log k)` time complexity, where `N` is the total number of nodes across all lists and `k` is the number of lists.
- This approach ensures that the final merged list maintains sorted order using a divide-and-conquer strategy.
