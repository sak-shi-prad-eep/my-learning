# Question
## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### Example 1:

Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`  
Output: `5`  
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = `6 - 1 = 5`.  
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

### Example 2:

Input: `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = `0`.

# Logic

## maxProfit Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Use two pointers: `l` (left) starting at the beginning of the array (index 0) and `r` (right) starting at the second element (index 1).
   - Initialize a variable `res` to store the maximum profit found, starting with `0`.

2. **Iterate Through Prices:**
   - Use a while loop to iterate as long as `r` is less than the length of the prices array.
   - If the price at `l` (buy day) is less than the price at `r` (sell day), calculate the profit as `prices[r] - prices[l]` and update `res` with the maximum value between the current calculated profit and the previous maximum profit.
   - If the price at `l` is not less than the price at `r`, move the left pointer to the position of the right pointer (`l = r`) to potentially find a better buying day.

3. **Move the Right Pointer:**
   - Always move the right pointer one step to the right (`r += 1`) to check the next day.

4. **Return Result:**
   - After the loop ends, return the maximum profit stored in `res`.

### Summary:
- The `maxProfit` function uses a two-pointer technique to find the maximum profit from a single buy-sell transaction.
- The left pointer tracks the day to buy, and the right pointer tracks the day to sell.
- The method ensures efficiency by moving the pointers based on the comparison of prices, allowing it to find the best buy-sell combination in a single pass through the array.
