# Question
## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and `n` times. Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: The original array was `[1,2,3,4,5]` rotated 3 times.

### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation: The original array was `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` and it was rotated 4 times.

### Example 3:

Input: `nums = [11,13,15,17]`  
Output: `11`  
Explanation: The original array was `[11,13,15,17]` and it was rotated 4 times.

## findMin Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Initialize `res` with the first element of `nums` as a starting point for the minimum element.
   - Use two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) initialized to the beginning and end of the array respectively.

2. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - Use a while loop to perform binary search until `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Check if the array segment from `nums[l]` to `nums[r]` is sorted by comparing `nums[l]` with `nums[r]`. If true, `nums[l]` is the minimum element in this segment, so update `res` with `min(res, nums[l])` and break out of the loop.
   
3. **Midpoint Calculation:**
   - Calculate the midpoint `m` as `(l + r) // 2`.

4. **Adjust Pointers Based on Comparison:**
   - Compare `nums[m]` with `nums[l]`:
     - If `nums[m] >= nums[l]`, it means the left half from `l` to `m` is sorted. Adjust `l` to `m + 1`.
     - Otherwise, adjust `r` to `m - 1` because the pivot point (minimum element) lies in the left half.
   
5. **Return Result:**
   - After the loop ends, `res` contains the minimum element found during the search, which is returned as the result.

### Summary:
- The `findMin` function employs a binary search strategy to efficiently find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.
- It adjusts the search range based on comparisons between the midpoint and the left boundary, ensuring that the algorithm runs in `O(log n)` time complexity.
- This approach leverages the properties of the rotated sorted array to quickly narrow down the search space and identify the minimum element.
