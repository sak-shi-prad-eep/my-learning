# Question
## 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

### Example 1:
Input: `list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]`  
Output: `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`

### Example 2:
Input: `list1 = [], list2 = []`  
Output: `[]`

### Example 3:
Input: `list1 = [], list2 = [0]`  
Output: `[0]`

## mergeTwoLists Function Explanation:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Create a `dummy` node and a `tail` pointer initialized to `dummy`. This helps in easily constructing the merged list.

2. **Merge Lists:**
   - Use a while loop to iterate through `l1` and `l2` while both are not `None`. Compare the values of the current nodes pointed by `l1` and `l2`.
   - Append the smaller node (between `l1` and `l2`) to `tail.next`, and move the respective pointer (`l1` or `l2`) to its next node.
   - Move `tail` to `tail.next`.

3. **Append Remaining Nodes:**
   - After exiting the loop, if there are remaining nodes in `l1` or `l2` (i.e., `l1` is not `None` or `l2` is not `None`), append the remaining nodes directly to `tail.next`.

4. **Return Result:**
   - Return `dummy.next`, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list.

### Summary:
- The `mergeTwoLists` function merges two sorted linked lists into one sorted list by comparing nodes and splicing them together.
- It efficiently handles edge cases where one or both lists may be empty.
- By using a `dummy` node and `tail` pointer strategy, it ensures that the merged list is constructed in a straightforward manner.
- This approach maintains `O(m + n)` time complexity, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively, making it suitable for large lists.
