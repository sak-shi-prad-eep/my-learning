## My Learning Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive tracker of my learning process, documenting the questions I have practiced and the corresponding logic used to solve them. Each folder within this repository corresponds to the source from where the question was obtained. Inside each folder, you will find files containing the question description (`qX.md`) and its corresponding solution (`qX.py`).

### Purpose

The primary objectives of this repository are:
- **Tracking Progress:** Documenting my learning journey and progress over time.
- **Revision Aid:** Providing a resource for revisiting questions and solutions for revision purposes.

### Structure

The repository is organized into folders named after the source of each question. Each folder contains:
- A markdown file (`qX.md`) describing the question statement.
- A Python file (`qX.py`) containing the solution code.
